# 🚗 Vehicle Rental Database Project – DBS211

Final Project for **DBS211 – Database Systems**  
Seneca College | Summer 2024 | Group 8

## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a complete relational database solution for a **Vehicle Rental Company** that handles both day-to-day transactions and long-term data analysis. It was developed as part of the final project for the DBS211 course at Seneca College.

The database is designed to manage critical business functions including customer registration, employee roles, vehicle inventory, rental processing, insurance management, and payment tracking. Additionally, the system includes advanced **SQL Views** for generating meaningful business insights — such as revenue trends, rental frequency, and average rental durations.

This project not only demonstrates our team’s understanding of **data modeling**, **SQL scripting**, and **normalization** (up to 3NF), but also shows how a well-structured database can support a scalable real-world software application.

- **Total Rentals per Customer**
- **Total Revenue per Vehicle**
- **Monthly Revenue by Date**
- **Average Rental Duration by Vehicle Type**

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Create the database schema:**
   Run `sql_scripts/DBS211_finalproject_creation_script.sql`
2. **Insert sample data:**
   Run `sql_scripts/DBS211_sample_data.sql`
3. **Generate business views:**
   Run `sql_scripts/DBS211_business_reports.sql`

Scripts are tested to execute cleanly in Oracle-compatible environments like **SQL Developer**.
